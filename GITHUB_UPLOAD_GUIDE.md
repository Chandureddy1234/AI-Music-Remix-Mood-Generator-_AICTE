# 🚀 GitHub Upload Guide - AI Music Generator

## Your Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/Chandureddy1234/AI-Music-Remix-Mood-Generator-_AICTE.git

## ✅ Quick Upload Instructions

### Option 1: Using the Automated Script (EASIEST)

I've created an automated script that will do everything for you!

**Just run this command:**

```bash
# Windows (in your project folder)
upload_to_github.bat
```

**Or for Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x upload_to_github.sh
./upload_to_github.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Initialize git repository
2. ✅ Add your GitHub repository as remote
3. ✅ Stage all files
4. ✅ Create a commit
5. ✅ Push everything to GitHub

### Option 2: Manual Upload (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to do it manually, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Initialize Git**
```bash
cd "c:/Users/KALLY/OneDrive/Desktop/AI/AI music generator"
git init
```

**Step 2: Add Remote Repository**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Chandureddy1234/AI-Music-Remix-Mood-Generator-_AICTE.git
```

**Step 3: Stage All Files**
```bash
git add .
```

**Step 4: Create First Commit**
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Music Remix & Mood Generator - Complete Project"
```

**Step 5: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When you push, GitHub will ask for credentials:

**If you have 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "AI Music Generator Upload"
4. Select scope: ✅ **repo** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_...`)
7. When git asks for password, **paste the token** instead

**If you DON'T have 2FA:**
- Username: `Chandureddy1234`
- Password: Your GitHub password
